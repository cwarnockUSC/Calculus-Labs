This workspace is a Binder directory where you can create new IPython Notebook files and upload existing ones.

If you wish to create a new Notebook file, simply click New in the top right of the directory page and choose SageMath 9.2.

If instead you wish to upload a Notebook file, click Upload in the top right and navigate to where the file is saved on your computer.

In both cases, your notebook file will not be saved once you close the Binder session, so make sure to choose File - Download As - Notebook (.ipynb) to download your work as a IPython notebook file. You can also save your work as a PDF by choosing File - Print Preview, then using your browswer's Print to PDF function.
