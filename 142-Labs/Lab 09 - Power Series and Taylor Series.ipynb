    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two fundamental questions to ask about a power series $\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(x-a)^n.$\n",
    "1. For what values of $x$ does the infinite sum converge?\n",
    "2. When the series converges, to what function does it converge? Notice that, in this case, the series is the Taylor series of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can answer the first question by finding the radius of convergence using the ratio test for absolute convergence and then checking the endpoints if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question, is in general, much more difficult to answer. One useful technique is to apply common operation (substitution, multiplication, division, differntiation, integration, $\\dots$) to a known power series, such as the Taylor series of a basic function. Also, SageMath can usually determine the function that a series converges to.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important application of power series is to approximate a function using partial sums of its Taylor series, known as Taylor polynomials. The accuracy of the approximation depends on the size of the interval called for and the number of terms used in the partial sum. We will visualize this approximation using SageMath.\n",
