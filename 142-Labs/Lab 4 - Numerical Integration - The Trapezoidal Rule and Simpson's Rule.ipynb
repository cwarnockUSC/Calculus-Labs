    "\n",
    "As we learned in Calculus I, there are two ways to evaluate a definite integral: using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus or using numerical approximations such as Reimann Sums. While the FTC is nice in theory, it cannont be applied in many cases, as antiderivatives are often difficult or even impossible to find. With the help of computers, using numerical integration is the most practical way to evaluate definite integrals. In this lab, we will use the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule to approximate definite integrals.\n",

    "In Calculus I, we learned how to use rectangles to approximate the definite integral. Another geometic figure which can be used to approximate the definite integeral is a trapezoid. Recall that the area of a trapzoid is $A = \\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2)$. In order to use trapezoids to approximate the definite integral, we subdivide the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals of equal length $\\Delta x = \\frac{b-a}{n}$. Then, on each subinterval we let $h = \\Delta x$ and $b_1 = f(x_{i-1})$ and $b_2 = f(x_i)$. Thus, the area of the trapzoid in the $i^\\text{th}$ subinterval is $A = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}(f(x_{i-1}) + f(x_i))$. Therefore, we have the following approximation of the definite integral using the Trapezoid Rule: $$\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x) \\ dx \\approx \\dfrac{\\Delta x}{2}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\big(f(x_{i-1}) + f(x_i)\\big),$$ where $n$ is the number of trapezoids we are using in our approximation and $x_i = a + i \\Delta x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using trapezoids, we are essentially approximating the curve $y=f(x)$ using piecewise linear functions. In Simpson's Rule, we will instead approximate $y = f(x)$ using piecewise quadratic functions. This time, we start by subdividing the interval $[a,b]$ into $2n$ subintervals of equal length $\\Delta x$ = $\\frac{b - a}{2n}$. On each pair of subintevals $[i-1,i]$ and $[i, i+1]$ with $i$ odd, we approximate the area spanned by the two subintervals with $A = \\frac{\\Delta x}{3}(f(x_{i-1}) + 4f(x_i) + f(x_{i+1})$. Therefore, we have the following approximation of the definite integral using Simpson's Rule: $$\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x) \\ dx \\approx \\dfrac{\\Delta x}{3} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\big( f(x_{2i}) + 4f(x_{2i+1}) + f(x_{2i + 2})\\big)$$ where $n$ is half of the number of subintervals we are using in our approximation and $x_i = a + i \\Delta x$."
